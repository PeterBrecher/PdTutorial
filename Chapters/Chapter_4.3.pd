#X text 38 546 Clicking on the left Bang is equivalent to clicking
on the 440 and 1 Messages at once. This sends the value 440 to the
oscillator telling it to play with frequency 440 and the value 1 to
the multiplier \, telling it to play with full volume. Clicking the
right Bang does the same thing \, but with the Messages of 880 and
0.5.;

#X text 37 708 Create a chord of A Major using oscillators. In other
words \, create 3 oscillators that each play a different note from
the A Major chord. The tones that consist A Major and their frequencies
are as follows: A 440 Hz C# 554.37 Hz E 659.25 Hz Make sure you can
activate the chord with one click.;

#X text 34 924 (You can now close every page of this chapter);
#X text 38 87 Now we ran into a problem. Our oscillator does not know
what to play. It has too many options. And as described in Lesson 2
\, Messages are activated by clicking on them. However \, how can we
click on 2 Messages at once - the frequency and the volume? For this
\, there is a very useful object called Bang.;
#X text 39 179 A Bang is like a mouse click \, but enables us to click
at as many objects at once as we connect to it. So let's add 2 Bangs
into our patch - one for the first tone and one for the second one.
