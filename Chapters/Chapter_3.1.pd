#X text 65 94 In the previous lesson we learned that numbers are pretty
useful in Pure Data. However \, what are numbers without mathematical
operations \, right? Of course \, Pure Data has support for these \,
so let's take a look at them! You can find all four types of basic
arithmetic operations in Pd: addition \, subtraction \, multiplication
\, and division.;
#X obj 70 205 +;
#X obj 70 253 -;
#X obj 69 302 *;
#X obj 68 348 /;
#X text 114 206 Addition;
#X text 114 254 Subtraction;
#X text 115 298 Multiplication;
#X text 116 346 Division;
#X text 66 408 Remember the little wave symbol in the oscillator and
dac objects? It's called a tilde and it means that the object works
with audio signals. If you want to apply arithmetic operations on the
output of such objects \, you have to use a different version of them
which are also marked with a tilde.;
#X obj 70 521 +~;
#X obj 124 521 -~;
#X obj 178 521 *~;
#X obj 233 521 /~;
#X text 62 581 These operations have one very important property. As
you can see they have two inlets and each works a little bit differently.
Let's say you connect two numbers to the "+" object \, each number
to one of the inlets. The operation will be performed only after you
enter the number that is connected to the leftmost inlet of the operation.
Let's illustrate it on the following example:;
#X obj 65 716 bng 15 250 50 0 empty empty empty 17 7 0 10 -262144 -1
