#X text 47 80 Metro;
#X text 42 117 The metro object may be more familiar to those who have
studied or played music \, as it is the Pure Data-version of a metronome.

#X text 42 286 Can you try to construct a patch using the "metro" object
that would send out bangs every 1000 milliseconds?;

#X text 42 180 The main purpose of this object is to send out Bangs
on regular intervals. The object can be turned on or off by sending
a 0 or a 1 to its left inlet \, for example by a Toggle or a pair of
Messages. Its right inlet expects a number and this argument defines
how often in milliseconds the Bangs will be sent out from its outlet.

#X text 40 409 Delay and Pipe;
#X text 41 447 The Delay and Pipe objects both receive some type of
data and then after a certain time send this data out from their output.
What is the difference between them and what kind of data are we talking
about?;
#X text 41 525 Delay: It should receive a Bang to its input and then
after the number of milliseconds defined in its argument sends this
Bang out.;
#X text 42 583 Pipe: The type of data that a Pipe can receive is more
flexible as it can be either a symbol or a number. In case the object
should receive a symbol \, this has to be specified in its argument.
