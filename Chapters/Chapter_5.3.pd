#X text 52 344 The above Trigger will send out a Bang from each of
its outlets. And the order will be the following: first from the right
outlet \, then the left one.;

#X text 49 77 We can now activate the patch the same way as before
\, but by deactivating the Toggle we can make it silent again.;
#X text 49 124 Let's do one final adjustment. We keep making the patch
play by 3 clicks. To replace the 3 clicks by 1 while making sure we
stick to the order of operations (right -> left) \, we will use a Trigger
object.;
#X text 50 199 A Trigger can take several types of inputs \, in our
case we will use a Bang. When it receives an input \, it sends something
out of its outlets. What it will be is defined by its arguments. For
example:;
#X connect 3 0 5 0;
