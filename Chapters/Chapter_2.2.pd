#X text 42 84 Let's learn about messages through the same example as
before. These objects are oftentimes very similar to Numbers. Delete
the Number from the previous example and replace it by a Message. You
create a message by clicking on "Put" and then "Message". What to write
inside the object?;
#X text 44 180 Well \, that depends on what you want to do with it
\, messages are very flexible! In this case we are going to replace
the Number object \, so let's write the same content: 440 Now just
click on the message and you should hear the same sound again.;
#X text 42 404 What is the difference between a Number and a Message?
What are their use cases?;
#X text 40 457 A Number acts as a "real time" display of a value that
is currently being processed in the patch. Remember how you could only
edit the number when not in edit mode?;
#X text 40 516 On the contrary \, a Message's contents are defined
at its creation and cannot be changed outside of Edit mode when the
patch is "running". In addition \, a Message can contain many other
types of values apart from a number. That will become clearer in later
lessons.;
#X text 40 603 You may ask what is the point of the Number object then.
There are many cases when you need to change a value while the patch
is running \, and creating a separate Message for each possible value
so that you can switch between them by clicking on them is not very
practical. Plus sometimes you want to observe what an output value
is and Numbers are greatly suited for that.;
#X text 41 720 Even though we did not see it in the example \, Numbers
can be connected to an object's outlet too \, and if the object is
producing some value \, then it will be displayed in the Number in
real time.;
