of a Number. As described in Lesson 2 \, Messages and Numbers can sometimes
be interchangeable.;

#X text 37 100 Let's take short break from learning new objects. You
know how to create a sound of any frequency in Pure Data now. However
\, how do we control the volume of what is being played? (Except from
turning off the DSP).;
#X text 35 174 For that we have the multiplication object with a tilde
(~). As you know \, this object does the multiplication operation on
audio signals.;
#X text 35 235 What happens if we multiply a soundwave with a number?
It changes its amplitude \, in other words it changes how loud it is.
The lower the number the lower the volume \, with 0 being absolutely
silent.;
#X text 35 309 Let's say we are working on a patch and we already have
an oscillator \, but we do not want to hear its sound while we are
trying out some other sounds. For this \, we can create an oscillator
that is mute:;
