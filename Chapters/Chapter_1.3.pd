#X text 52 814 (You can now close all pages of this chapter);
#X text 56 162 You can connect two objects by hovering your mouse over
one object's outlet (or inlet) until your mouse pointer turns into
a circle. Then you click and drag the line that appears to the other
object's inlet or outlet.;
#X text 55 311 After connecting the second line \, a steady sound should
be playing. If that is the case \, go back to the first Pd window \,
untick the "DSP" box and let's find out what happened. We created an
Oscillator object with the information 440;
#X text 56 410 We call an information that is after an object's name
an argument because it tells us about the properties of the object.
;
#X text 57 472 As you may know \, an oscillator's function is to create
a sound wave. So in this case \, the argument of 440 tells it to create
a sound wave with the frequency of 440 Hz. This sound wave is produced
by the oscillator \, and therefore is its output.;
#X text 57 568 We already know that an object's output is sent out
through its outlet. The lines connecting the two objects are called
wires and they transport the information between objects that they
connect. The sound wave is therefore transported to the Digital Analog
Converter's inlets. There are two inlets \, because the sound we are
working on is stereo.;
#X text 56 680 The Converter does not have any arguments \, because
it does not need one. It already receives everything it needs from
the Oscillator (the sound wave). The Converter then takes the received
sound wave and converts it to actual sound that you heard.;
#X text 57 103 Let's create another object and name it "dac~" (Digital
Analog Converter) and connect the oscillator to both inlets of this
object.;
