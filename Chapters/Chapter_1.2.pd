#X text 60 319 First make sure you have your worksheet open. Now click
on "Put" and then the "Object" button in the taskbar. When a square-looking
structure appears next to your mouse \, just click anywhere on the
blank page to "put it down". Now write "osc~ 440" into it and then
click anywhere in the empty window.;
#X text 59 90 The bulk of work with Pure Data revolves around objects.
What are objects \, you ask? Well \, let's first create one and learn
about them through an example.;
#X text 60 153 Before you proceed \, there is one very important concept
to remember: Pure Data has two modes - one where you can edit the patch
(marked by [edit] next to the patch name) and one where you cannot
edit it. Switching between these two modes is done either by pressing
Ctrl and E or clicking on "Edit" and then "Edit mode". I recommend
doing it the former way.;
#X text 61 260 So make sure you are in Edit mode and let's proceed
to the example.;
#X text 58 511 Congrats \, you have created your first object! Its
name is Oscillator and the little wave after its name signalized that
it works with audio signals.;
#X text 59 640 Now an object by itself does not do much. That's why
it has those three black marks on it. The marks that appear on the
top of the object \, above the name are called inlets.;
#X text 59 703 An inlet's function is to receive data from other objects.
However \, some objects can receive data by writing it after their
name \, like in this case. Our Oscillator receives the number 440;
#X text 60 778 The mark on the bottom is called an outlet \, and its
function is to send data out from the object.;
#X text 58 578 You can also delete an object by clicking on it and
then pressing the "Delete" key on your keyboard.;
#X text 92 419 If you need help \, click here to add this object to
your worksheet!;
