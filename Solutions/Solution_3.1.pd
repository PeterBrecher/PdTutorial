#X text 238 51 Step 1: Let's send the number 220 to the right inlet
of the addition operation. We can see that the result is still 0 Why?
Because we did not send anything to the leftmost inlet.;
#X text 230 170 Step 2: If we now enter 220 into the left Number object
that is connected to the leftmost inlet \, the operation gets activated
and the result changes.;
#X text 229 274 Step 3: However \, if we again send something to the
right inlet \, the result does not change. It's because the leftmost
inlet's input did not change from the previous state and so the operation
does not get "activated".;
#X text 234 376 Terminology Alert: Inlets that cause immediate change
are called hot inlets. Those that do not cause immediate change are
called cold inlets.;
