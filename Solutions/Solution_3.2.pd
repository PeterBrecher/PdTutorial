#X text 220 78 Explanation: The two Number objects send their value
to the addition operation. After entering the left number \, the operation
gets triggered and the result (440) gets sent to the oscillator \,
which then sends it to the converter and plays it on our computers.

#X text 223 195 FAQ;
#X text 220 233 Is this the only solution? No. You can use any two
numbers with the combination of any operation that would give us 440
as a result. So 440 * 1 would work too.;
#X text 223 302 Why did we not use the audio signal version of the
addition operation (+~)? The oscillator takes in a number and then
outputs a signal. So before we enter the oscillator we are still working
with ordinary numbers and hence there is no need to use a tilde.;
